Part of this assignment is learning to test and refine models. As such the following three questions were analyzed:

1) What was the lowest loss model?
2) Which model displayed the best accuracy tracking?
3) How was the window size determined?

### Question 1 and 2

The model with both the lowest loss and best accuracy tracking was the closing price predictor [closing price](lstm_stock_predictor_closing.ipynb). In addition to the loss metric calculated by Tensorflow, the supplemental measure of mean squared error was calculated to determine the best accuracy tracking.

Final Model with 100 Epochs				
Indicator	Window Size	Loss	MSE	Batch Size
Price	3	2.4%	 329,765,409 	5
FNG	3	4.3%	 1,265,817,273 	5


### Question 3

To determine the best window size. The model was run multiple times holding constant all other parameters except for window size. The best results was a window size of 3.

Window Size	Loss	MSE
1	5.0%	 902,580,900 
2	3.4%	 726,318,427 
3	2.4%	 329,765,409 
4	2.5%	 504,123,047 
5	2.6%	 547,440,813 
6	2.9%	 684,339,092 
10	2.9%	 655,312,756
